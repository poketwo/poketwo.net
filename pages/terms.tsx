            By purchasing or obtaining Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, you acknowledge and agree that they may only

                    <li>
                        An exception to the foregoing rule shall be made in cases where Virtual Currency or Virtual
                        Goods are compensated as an incentive for users to use Discord's "server boosting" feature.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            Additionally, you shall not host, participate in, or advertise events, giveaways, or competitions where
            Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods are offered as compensation or rewards for inviting users to join a
            Discord server or for advertising a Discord server ("invite rewards", "join rewards"). This prohibition

                they generate or the number of users who join through their invites; or
            </li>
            <li>otherwise using server invite activity as a basis for compensation or eligibility.</li>
