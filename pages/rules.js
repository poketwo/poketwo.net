                    Trade at your own risk. We provide resources such as #price-check, but it is your responsibility to

            <h2>Infractions</h2>
            <p>
                We generally follow a two-strike policy for our rules. If you notice someone breaking them, please
                mention or DM a staff member and we’ll deal with it as soon as we can.
            </p>
            <p>Possible actions we take include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A public verbal warning</li>
                <li>A formal bot warning</li>
                <li>A short temporary mute</li>
                <li>A long temporary mute</li>
                <li>A kick from the server</li>
                <li>A temporary ban from the server</li>
                <li>A permanent ban from the server</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While serious infractions are discussed internally before a punishment is given, simpler infractions are
                dealt with by individual staff members and the punishment they hand out is left to their own discretion.
